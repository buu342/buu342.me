            <p><p>When I was in High School, I was looking for some piano songs to play, and for some reason I recalled that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_of_the_Colossus">Shadow of the Colossus</a> (one of my favorite games of all time) has some really nice and short piano tracks in it. Being a very popular game, there were bound to be numerous transcriptions of the scores, but for some reason I brought it upon myself to transcribe one song just for fun. The song I chose was &quot;Memories&quot;, which is a track that only plays in the &quot;Image Gallery&quot; section of the main menu, only available in the European release of the game.</p>
<p>I originally wrote the transcription in an ancient notation software known as <a href="https://www.mozart.co.uk/">Mozart</a>. I will instead share a new version which I ported over to MuseScore, since the exported file looks much nicer. You can download it below in .zip format, which contains a PDF of the score and an exported MIDI.</p>
