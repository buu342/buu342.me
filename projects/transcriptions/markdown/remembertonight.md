Another track I quite enjoy from Andrew W.K.'s esotetic "Close Calls with Brick Walls" album. This track is relatively easy to play and memorize, but the difficulty comes from the speed. It's very much an endurance test for your forearm.

This song was also in Hal Leonard's "Andrew W.K. - The Very Best 2001-2009 - Guitar Tab Edition" book, but only the first 8 chords that are played (rather the first 6 notes repeated 8 times). I'm not sure why I chose to transcribe this one specifically, I guess it's just because I like it and it sounded like an easy score to play and sing together. 

Below is a zip file with a PDF and MIDI of the song. It was transcribed in [Studio One](https://www.presonus.com/pages/studio-one-pro) and written in score form using [MuseScore 4](https://musescore.org/en).
