This is a really easy and catchy song from Andrew W.K.'s underrated 2003 album "The Wolf". The song was actually first featured in AWK's EP album AWKGOJ as "Don't Ever Stop the Noise", and then it was remade for this album (AWKGOJ also features 3 other tracks that AWK fans might recognize).

This song doesn't seem to be very popular as I can't find any recordings of it being played live. It is luckily a relatively easy track to transcribe by ear, also helped by it being featured in AWKGOJ with a clearer piano track. The song (heh) can be played on a single piano, but the ending layers two more pianos to it. 

Below is a zip file with a MIDI of the song, no PDF of it as I haven't gotten around to porting it over to MuseScore since I would like to also add some bass to it. It was transcribed in [Studio One](https://www.presonus.com/pages/studio-one-pro).
