When I was in High School, I was looking for some piano songs to play, and for some reason I recalled that [Shadow of the Colossus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_of_the_Colossus) (one of my favorite games of all time) has some really nice and short piano tracks in it. Being a very popular game, there were bound to be numerous transcriptions of the scores, but for some reason I brought it upon myself to transcribe one song just for fun. The song I chose was "Memories", which is a track that only plays in the "Image Gallery" section of the main menu, only available in the European release of the game.

I originally wrote the transcription in an ancient notation software known as [Mozart](https://www.mozart.co.uk/). I will instead share a new version which I ported over to MuseScore, since the exported file looks much nicer. You can download it below in .zip format, which contains a PDF of the score and an exported MIDI.
