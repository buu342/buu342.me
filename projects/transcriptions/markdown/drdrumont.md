This is one of the "odd tracks" of Close Calls with Brick Walls. I believe the song is improvisational, since it doesn't really follow any specific rhythm or beat. Translating this to the page was quite a pain in the butt, and there were some artistic liberties from my part in translating the MIDI to score form. If you want an accurate beat, follow the MIDI, and use the paper only for helping you find notes.
