This is one of the "odd tracks" of Close Calls with Brick Walls (which is already an esoteric album for Andrew W.K. to begin with). I believe the song is improvisational, since it doesn't really follow any specific rhythm or beat. It's a short piano track, so I transcribed it as I am in need of some short scores in my repertoire.

Translating this one to the page was quite a pain in the butt, so there were some artistic liberties from my part in translating the MIDI to score form in order to make the sheet way more legible. If you want an accurate beat, follow the MIDI, and use the paper only for helping you find notes and fingering.
