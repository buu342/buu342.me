            <p><p>This is a really easy and catchy song from Andrew W.K.'s underrated 2003 album &quot;The Wolf&quot;. The song was actually first featured in AWK's EP album AWKGOJ as &quot;Don't Ever Stop the Noise&quot;, and then it was remade for this album (AWKGOJ also features 3 other tracks that AWK fans might recognize).</p>
<p>This song doesn't seem to be very popular as I can't find any recordings of it being played live. It is luckily a relatively easy track to transcribe by ear, also helped by it being featured in AWKGOJ with a clearer piano track. The song (heh) can be played on a single piano, but the ending layers two more pianos to it.</p>
<p>Below is a zip file with a MIDI of the song, no PDF of it as I haven't gotten around to porting it over to MuseScore since I would like to also add some bass to it. It was transcribed in <a href="https://www.presonus.com/pages/studio-one-pro">Studio One</a>.</p>
