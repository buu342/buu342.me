            <p><p>This is one of the &quot;odd tracks&quot; of Close Calls with Brick Walls (which is already an esoteric album for Andrew W.K. to begin with). I believe the song is improvisational, since it doesn't really follow any specific rhythm or beat. It's a short piano track, so I transcribed it as I am in need of some short scores in my repertoire.</p>
<p>Translating this one to the page was quite a pain in the butt, so there were some artistic liberties from my part in translating the MIDI to score form in order to make the sheet way more legible. If you want an accurate beat, follow the MIDI, and use the paper only for helping you find notes and fingering.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 11/04/2025:</strong></p>
<p>I was watching an episode of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_in_the_Middle">Malcolm in the Middle</a> yesterday, specifically Season 5, Episode 13. In this episode, Lois picks up her sister's phone, which is answered by a Dr. Dumont. Later in the episode, Andrew W.K.'s Long Live the Party plays when Malcolm and Reese head off for a party. Considering that this episode came out one year before Close Calls with Brick Walls, perhaps this song's name is a reference to this episode? That, or just a major conincidence!</p>
