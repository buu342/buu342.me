Monster Mash is a labour-of-love project between myself and my friend [Samuel Pearson](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198072642288/). I have been in charge of programming, while Samuel handled game design, art assets, and mapping. 

It is, in essence, a chaotic Halloween-themed deathmatch gamemode. Players choose a monster, pick a loadout, and battle each other for points. The gamemode's uniqueness comes from its dismemberment and scoring system. In Monster Mash, a player can lose limbs during combat, forcing them to hop on a single leg, crawl on the floor, or rely solely on headbutting people after losing both arms. Your loadout and limb count affects how many points you earn for a kill, which in turn helps you unlock special abilities. The game also features over 40 unique weapons, status effects, and wacky round modifiers.

Monster Mash started around 2016, and we released the first public version in 2018. We've been adding to the gamemode every year, so its design has changed throughout the years as we tried to balance the weapons and different systems. When October comes, we host public game servers to get a larger audience playtesting the project.
