Emote System is a pretty straight-forward WAD. It basically allows you to open an emote wheel by holding a button, and then moving your mouse in the direction of a specific emote, not to dissimilar to what many online games provide nowadays. The user is able to open a separate menu to get a full list of all emotes available on the server, and can decide which emote goes where on the wheel. And since emotes are completely clientsided, players can also optionally disable the emote system, or the ability for emotes to emit sound effects.

My emote system is designed to be very customizable and flexible. A [GitHub wiki](https://github.com/buu342/ACS-EmoteSystem/wiki) is provided along with the heavily documented source code, explaining how to install and configure the emote system for the server (such as setting cooldowns on spammers), and how to add more emotes to the WAD.
