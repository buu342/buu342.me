            <p><p>Pok&eacute;mon Go runs on Unity, so it's relatively easy to crack open and extract assets from it. Pok&eacute;mon Go does, however, not bundle all of its assets directly in the app, rather it downloads them as the game requires them (since it is an always online game, this is a smart move). Because Niantic, the game's developer, is not always the most reliable source of information, a small community called the Pok&eacute;Miners has formed to extract assets and figure out some mechanics (as well as what content we might get in the future). While I am not a full-time member of the Pok&eacute;Miners team, I have contributed my own extracted assets (and tools) to them and the Pok&eacute;mon Go reverse engineering community. I have <a href="https://github.com/PokeMiners/pogo_assets/issues/4#issuecomment-737507154">also provided help</a> for getting these extracted assets working in modeling software like Blender.</p>
