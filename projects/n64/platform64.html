            <p><p>Platform64 is one of the most ambitious projects I am working on. It is, in short, a retail-sized N64 game built entirely from scratch (game engine and tooling). Not only that, I am documenting the entire development process in an educational YouTube series that explores computer science practically applied to the N64. While I am currently working solo on the project, I do intend on getting more people onboard, which will require the tools to actually be decently put together.</p>
<p>The project is in its very early state, as I have not had time to work on it due to my dissertation and a bunch of other projects that I wanted to clear out first. Currently, all that exists is a basic operating system, a controller handler, and a basic game loop (as well as videos covering these different topics). I intend on focusing entirely on this project very soon.</p>
