            <p><p>The N64brew community, since 2020, hosts a game jam every year where we raise money for charity. And every time we host the jam, we like to change the format up a little bit, however in 2024, we decided to do something a bit different than usual. Typically we come up with a single word theme that the participants need to interpret for their entry, however this year we wanted to tackle one of the issues we had every year: people tend to overscope projects and not submit anything complete. So this time around the theme was &quot;minigames&quot;, and the idea was that we wrote a template which all the projects had to fork from. In the end, we merged everyone's games into one large minigame collection, similar to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiedwhJG71I">Pok&eacute;mon Stadium's Kids Club</a>.</p>
<p>This meant that this year, instead of just doing organizational stuff (as well as promotion, graphics, etc...) we also had to do quite a bit of work on the final entry as well. As part of the organization team, there were two Libdragon developers and myself: I wrote a big portion of the base template (including the loading of overlays and game loop with deltatimes), and mostly worked on the menus and savestate system in the final ROM.</p>
<p>The jam overall was a success, we raised more money for charity (1750$) and had more participants than in any previous year!</p>
