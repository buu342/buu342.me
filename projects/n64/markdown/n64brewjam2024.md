The N64brew community, since 2020, hosts a game jam every year where we raise money for charity. And every time we host the jam, we like to change the format up a little bit, however in 2024, we decided to do something a bit different than usual. Typically we come up with a single word theme that the participants need to interpret for their entry, however this year we wanted to tackle one of the issues we had every year: people tend to overscope projects and not submit anything complete. So this time around the theme was "minigames", and the idea was that we wrote a template which all the projects had to fork from. In the end, we merged everyone's games into one large minigame collection, similar to [Pok√©mon Stadium's Kids Club](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiedwhJG71I).

This meant that this year, instead of just doing organizational stuff (as well as promotion, graphics, etc...) we also had to do quite a bit of work on the final entry as well. As part of the organization team, there were two Libdragon developers and myself: I wrote a big portion of the base template (including the loading of overlays and game loop with deltatimes), and mostly worked on the menus and savestate system in the final ROM.

The jam overall was a success, we raised more money for charity ([1754$, which went to the Alzheimer's Association](images/AA.png)) and had more participants than in any previous year!
