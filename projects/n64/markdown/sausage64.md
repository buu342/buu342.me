Sausage64 is a suite of tools to allow users to bring their animated 3D models from Blender over to the Nintendo64.

The suite contains a Python plugin for Blender 2.7 and later, a previewer tool written in C++ using wxWidgets with OpenGL, a parser tool written in C, and finally the N64 side of the library (also written in C).

The library supports the models exported as either a array of C data, or in a custom binary format. The project is also extensively documented in order to allow users to extend and improve the library and/or tools.
