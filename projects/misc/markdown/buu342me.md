I bought this domain on a whim a very long time ago, but in 2024, after finishing my dissertation, I decided to make this website presentable. Because I am not a normal person, I decided to write my own static site generator as opposed to using one that already exists. The result is this website which you are using your eyeballs to gaze upon.

I wrote the SSG in C++ using wxWidgets. It stores the website's structure in a JSON file and markdown files, which the tool then parses and builds the pages of any entry which has changed. To generate the pages, it uses a bunch of template HTML files and replaces some key words in the files with the different contents generated by the markdown parser.

A blog post that covers the entire development process of this website is available below.
