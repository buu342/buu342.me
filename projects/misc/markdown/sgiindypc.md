After using an Alienware M14X for the better of 11 years, I thought it was time to finally upgrade my PC. Thanks to my work in [Chex Quest HD](../unreal/chexquesthd.html), I finally had the budget to do so. However, instead of just building a normal (boring) computer, I opted to build a sleeper PC using the shell of an SGI Indy that I had lying around. I designed a custom metal chassis and had it laser cut, ensuring that I would not need to damage or modify any actual SGI parts.

The full build process can be read in my blog, linked below, which also has links for the CAD parts if you wish to build one yourself. The short of it is, if you want to build one for the aesthetics (and for having a truly unique PC), go for it! Just be aware that you might be leaving some performance on the table due to the Indy's less than stellar cooling capatibilities.
