Shotgun Ninja is a parkour platformer that is very much inspired by the [flash game N](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N_(video_game)). You play a Ninja who's sensei gets kidnapped, so you journey the lands in search of them. Along the way, you pick up a shotgun, which both serves as a weapon and as a travel mechanic since its recoil is huge. The game involved solving platform puzzles, such as using the shotgun to act as a mid-air jump to cross large gaps, or even as a method to quickly change your air direction to dodge rockets.

I had quite a lot of fun making levels for this project as I found the shotgun a really cool travel mechanic, but I never ended up finishing it as I felt a bit overwhelmed with needing to make a lot of character sprites (something I'm still not great at to this day). As a result, I only really finished the first world of the game, which was 14 levels and a boss fight. It did have a built-in level editor, with the idea being that people could share their own custom levels like in N.
