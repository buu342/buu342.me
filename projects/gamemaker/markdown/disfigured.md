During work on [Slender's Forest](slendersforest.html), I kinda grew out of the creepypasta mythos and I wanted to pivot my game to something else. I still wanted it to be horror themed (obviously), but I just wanted it to be my *own* thing. So instead I started work on a FPS horror game called Disfigured, where the main character would wake up in an unknown cell inside some big mansion. The player would have to solve puzzles to find out what happened, and how to escape. Unfortunately, inside the mansion there are a bunch of disfigured monsters roaming about who aren't too happy that you broke out of the cell.

Honestly despite not having done much with this project, I am really happy with what I *did* put together considering my age and experience. There's some cool scripted sequences in the first level, including a jump scare that I have yet to meet anyone who hasn't been caught off-guard by it. 

Why did this project fall apart? Well, you can probably guess by looking at most of my other projects: overambition by a 14 year old boy. I was still not quite comfortable with 3D graphics and so I was struggling with a bunch of 3D collision logic. The two levels I put together for this project were entirely flat, and when I tried to implement an underwater section in the second level I pretty much gave up on the project.
