The early 2010's was the height of indie horror: [Amnesia: The Dark Descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesia:_The_Dark_Descent) came out in September of 2010, causing a hydrogen bomb that blew into the indie horror genre. 2012 had the release of many indie darlings like [Slender: The Eight Pages](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slender:_The_Eight_Pages) and [SCP-087](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiHQN1q8ln4), which subsequently (as well as a consequence of) kickstarted the YouTube reaction channel trend where Swedish guys yell at barrels.

Being a teen with (a frankly) unresponsible access to the internet and a game creation tool, it certainly got me inspired into making my own stuff that could one day give me the 10 minutes of fame. I was a big fan of [Creepypastas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creepypasta), especially ones with video components like [Obey the Walrus](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/obedece-a-la-morsa-obey-the-walrus), [Suicide Mouse](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/suicide-mouse), and [Obey the Walrus](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/obedece-a-la-morsa-obey-the-walrus), so I thought that I would put together a game which brings together all the "lore" of the different stories. While the game was titled after Slender Man to cash in on their popularity, the anorexic gentlemen would only serve a minor role in the grand scheme. And this project was gonna be hyper realistic. You can even see your own character's feet if you look down!!!

Ultimately, despite my vigorous ambitions, I was not able to advance very far in the project as I had difficulties with 3D collision as I attempted to take the project past a dark and spooky forest.
