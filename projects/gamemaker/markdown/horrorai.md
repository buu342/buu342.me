Spending a lot of time making horror games, I eventually needed to have some decent working AI. I first wrote a little top-down project where an AI would explore a map by traveling to random waypoints, and begin chasing the player player as soon as they were spotted or were close enough. Once the monster lost sight, it would continue pursing by visiting the last known location of the player, and once enough time had passed, it would give up and resume searching again. 

I then translated this project over to 3D, and implemented a noise system. I made it so that running and walking over noisy surfaces (like water) would also make the AI investigate these areas, and I added some sound effects when the player is spotted or when they successfully manage to escape. I then got a bit carried away and distracted with making dynamic lights, 3D collision, water with reflections (which is done by just drawing the world twice) and swaying grass. The plan was that I could then reuse this AI for some more interesting projects, or even port it over to [existing](isohorror.html) [ones](disfigured.html), but I eventually moved on from Game Maker.

I wrote this in GM8 as opposed to GM:S because that would allow me to reuse some work from previous projects instead of having to deal with fixing bugs of porting over the 3D stuff to Studio.
