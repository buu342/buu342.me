Not wanting to throw away some of the work I put into making models and the animation system for [my previous project](isohorror), I was inspired by some games such as [Downwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downwell_(video_game)) to instead make an arcade game. The idea I drew up was Tower Dive: You play a knight who wants to rescue a princess on the top floor of a circular tower that reaches all the way into space. As you climb the tower, the traps get more dangerous, the jumps become harder, and the enemies start having new abilities. As you climb and defeat enemies, you collect coins, which would have served to enter shops which could provide health or weapon upgrades. You could have also encounted boss gates, which you would fight a tough enemy blocking an elevator that could bring you up many hundreds of meters. Mechnically and visually, the project drew heavily from a small section in the [third castle of Mystical Ninja 2: Starring Goemon](https://youtu.be/FyChM0eJZlM?t=278).

Like many of my other projects around this time, this one suffered due to my need to focus on the International Baccalaureate and the juggling of many other smaller projects in Garry's Mod. This is a project that I really want to revisit sometime in the future, since I think there's a lot of potential for some fun mechanics and visuals.
