            <p><p>The early 2010's was the height of indie horror: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesia:_The_Dark_Descent">Amnesia: The Dark Descent</a> came out in September of 2010, causing a hydrogen bomb that blew into the indie horror genre. 2012 had the release of many indie darlings like <a href="https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slender:_The_Eight_Pages">Slender: The Eight Pages</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiHQN1q8ln4">SCP-087</a>, which subsequently (as well as a consequence of) kickstarted the YouTube reaction channel trend where Swedish guys yell at barrels.</p>
<p>Being a teen with (a frankly) unresponsible access to the internet and a game creation tool, it certainly got me inspired into making my own stuff that could one day give me the 10 minutes of fame. I was a big fan of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creepypasta">Creepypastas</a>, especially ones with video components like <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/obedece-a-la-morsa-obey-the-walrus">Obey the Walrus</a>, <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/suicide-mouse">Suicide Mouse</a>, and <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/obedece-a-la-morsa-obey-the-walrus">Obey the Walrus</a>, so I thought that I would put together a game which brings together all the &quot;lore&quot; of the different stories. While the game was titled after Slender Man to cash in on their popularity, the anorexic gentlemen would only serve a minor role in the grand scheme. And this project was gonna be hyper realistic. You can even see your own character's feet if you look down!!!</p>
<p>Ultimately, despite my vigorous ambitions, I was not able to advance very far in the project as I had difficulties with 3D collision as I attempted to take the project past a dark and spooky forest.</p>
