            <p><p>Red is a twin-stick shooter <em>in the purest sense of the word</em>. It is also a fully finished game, that was basically ready to be published. Essentially, Red is a game where you play a green block that shoots an infinite barrage of white blocks. Red blocks of different sizes keep spawning from the corners, and your job is to survive for as long as possible, collecting blue blocks to help restore your health (which is represented by the background. The darker it is, the closer you are to death). The game has two difficulty modes: Hard and Nightmare.</p>
<p>Being annoyed at the constant dropping of projects because art is hard, I decided to purposefully create something that was as simple as possible. Everything is just colored blocks, and that is more than enough for you to play and enjoy this game. With the opening of Steam Greenlight, I decided to try my luck and put my game out there. To do so, I added boss battles, an achievement system, and even an online high-score table. The response to the game was, expectedly, negative. Gamers aren't really convinced by Atari 2600 graphics, even if the game I wanted to publish was free.</p>
<p>Apparently, that same year, a game called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devil_Daggers">Devil Daggers</a> was greenlit on Steam which shares an eerily similar concept, except it's done in first person and with Quake graphics. Despite it having been impossible, I still think this game copied me and I have sworn to get revenge on Sorath one day &gt;:(</p>
