Unfortunately, most of the things I made were published on the (now defunct) YoYo Games Sandbox... Game Maker is a fantastic engine for 2D projects, but after moving on to GM8 I started really wanting to push the engine to making 3D games. It wasn't really its strong suit, and it didn't really provide tooling or even collision functions for it. That meant that I had to start learning game development \"properly\", like implementing collisions, physics, and tooling. \n\nAs is the usually the case for most people, a huge chunk of my projects have gone unfinished, but here are some things which I think are worth looking at. The dates for a lot of these unfinished projects are the rough estimate of when I stopped working on them, based on file dates.",

Ultimately, I think I made the right choice, because this console forced me to seriously _learn_ programming. While the N64 is a relatively beefy machine, it is still very much in the realm of embedded systems programming, where you need to know the hardware well and profile your code, lest your game run at sub 15 FPS (or you wreck the stack).\n\nI am also the current owner of the [N64brew](https://discord.gg/WqFgNWf) community on Discord, where I have been serving as both a moderator and trying to help out with programming related inquiries. I am also one of the main organizers for the [N64brew Game Jam](https://n64brew.dev/wiki/Category:Game_Jams) that we try to host every year.",
